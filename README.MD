# 📚 Library Management System

A **Library Management System** built using **C++** to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This system allows for efficient management of book inventory and user records.

## 🚀 Features

- **Book Inventory Management**: Add, remove book details.
- **User Management**: Track user information and borrowed books.
- **Data Handling**: Uses encapsulation and abstraction for better code structure and maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Built to simulate real-world library processes.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Implement **inheritance** and **polymorphism** to improve functionality and scalability.
- Add more advanced features.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sabkat-ahmed-rafi/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd library-management-system/src
   ```

3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o library-management-system
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./library-management-system
   ```
